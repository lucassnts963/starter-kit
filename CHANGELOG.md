## [Unreleased]

> Methodology version 1.1.0. See `METHODOLOGY.md## Methodology Versions` for the structure changelog.

### Added
- **Memory as an LLM-Wiki** (inspired by Karpathy's LLM-Wiki): `.specs/memory/troubleshooting.md`
  (topical error/fix memory, `TRB-NN`) with the `record-troubleshooting` skill, and an append-only
  `.specs/memory/log.md` working journal.
- **Two-tier consistency:** the `review-alignment` skill — an adversarial LLM check that a spec
  faithfully covers its requirements — producing a stamped `alignment-review.md` verdict.
- **Methodology versioning** (`.specs/config.md## Methodology Version`) and the `upgrade-methodology`
  skill, which brings an existing methodology project up to the kit's latest version non-destructively.
- **Generated skills index** (`.claude/skills/INDEX.md` via `scripts/update-skills-index.mjs`): the
  single source for the skills catalog, compiled from each `SKILL.md`. `AGENTS.md`/`README` reference
  it instead of hand-maintaining the list; `check-consistency` + CI enforce it stays in sync.
- **Session continuity** ("where you left off"): `scripts/session-context.mjs` summarizes the latest
  `log.md` entry, specs in flight (with alignment-gate state), and requirements without a spec. Wired
  as a Claude Code `SessionStart` hook (`.claude/settings.json`) and runnable via the `resume-session`
  skill (`"onde paramos"`) — harness-agnostic, silent when there's nothing to resume.

### Changed
- `check-consistency.mjs` gained four checks: troubleshooting-entry schema, requirements↔spec
  traceability integrity, no-dangling-`REQ`, and a **blocking alignment gate** on archived specs.
- `feature-spec.md` traceability now uses a portable relative Markdown link (GitHub + Obsidian); the
  canonical join key is the `REQ` id, not the link syntax.
- `run-change`, `run-tdd`, and `gather-requirements` now route through `review-alignment` at the
  requirements→spec transition and gate archiving on an `aligned` verdict.

### Fixed
- Projects bootstrapped from the kit no longer inherit the kit's own `CHANGELOG.md`. A clean
  `.specs/templates/changelog-template.md` is shipped, and `init-project`/`create-project` reset the
  project's `CHANGELOG.md` (plus `package.json` identity and `README.md`) from it; `adopt-project`
  creates a clean one only when the project has none.
